-- DON'T TOUCH ANY OF THIS
-- there's stuff you can touch, scroll down to the definition of the World record to find it

{-
(Sorry if I use tick and frame interchangeably. It shouldn't hinder clarity though)
World is the record that stores all the data required by the game. The function that you have to define yourself that runs every frame (loopFunc) takes world as a parameter (see the general setup section in the readme). You can use loopFunc to modify the state of the game, then return the new state of the game at the end of the function. The next frame, that new state of the game that you just defined will be passed as a parameter to loopFunc. This is how you can update the game state every frame.

Inside of the World record (whose contents are mainly up to you) is the WorldRaw record (whose contents you should not change). Take a look through the WorldRaw record. It contains a lot of data whose initialisation is abstracted from you, like the renderer. Since loopFunc only provides you access to World, accessing fields of WorldRaw is a bit cumbersome, as you have to unpack some values. To simplify access of WorldRaw fields, you can use the provided getters and setters in this file.

Take a look through WorldRaw and its corresponding functions to see what stuff is available to you
Remember that you can add your own fields to World, just don't remove World's wr field
